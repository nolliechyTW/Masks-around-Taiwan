# Masks-around-Taiwan
Use Open Data to analyze mask distribution in Taiwan's district and cities.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people in Taiwan are required to wear mask whenever they are not at home by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).    
This program is written to answer a question: is the proportion of the number of masks in each district and city consistent with the proportion of the population?
